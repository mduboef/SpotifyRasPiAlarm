# spotipyRasPiAlarm
For personal use.

A slapped together alarm meant to run on a Rasberry Pi.

Uses pyautogui to automatically play music and news from spotify for web.

I should have gone through the Spotify API but I'm lazy. I'll probably change it one day.

Uses Raspian with small bottom taskbar and Chromium (Media Version) with bookmarks.
